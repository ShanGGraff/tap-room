# Tap Room

####  Tap Rooom is an application where a user can keep track of their inventory of kegs. The main page lists all kegs in the inventory along with a button that opens a form to add kegs to the inventory. A user should be able to view the name, brand, price, and alcohol content for each keg listed on each kegs detail page after clicking on the name of the individual keg. Also, on the detail page is a button to order a pint of that particular beer and which decrements the amount of pints left after the order is submitted.
